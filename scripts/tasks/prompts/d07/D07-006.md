# D07-006: Generate and apply database migration for all Intelligence Engine tables

## Project Context
You are building **Meritum Health Technologies**, a self-serve medical billing platform for Alberta physicians (AHCIP + WCB claims). This is a monorepo with:
- `apps/api` — Fastify 5 REST API with Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL 16
- `apps/web` — Next.js 15 frontend
- `packages/shared` — Shared Drizzle schemas, Zod validators, constants, utilities

Tech stack: TypeScript, Fastify 5, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL 16, Vitest + Supertest, Lucia auth.

Read `CLAUDE.md` in the project root for full conventions (naming, structure, error handling, security, testing).

## Dependencies
This task depends on: **D07-002**, **D07-003**, **D07-004** (all schema tables must be defined).

## What to Build
Run the Drizzle migration generator for all Intelligence Engine tables:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm drizzle-kit generate
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

Verify migration created in `apps/api/drizzle/migrations/`.
Verify all 4 tables exist: ai_rules, ai_provider_learning, ai_specialty_cohorts, ai_suggestion_events.
Verify FK constraints to providers table (Domain 5) and claims table (Domain 4.0) resolve.
Verify UNIQUE constraints: (provider_id, rule_id) on ai_provider_learning, (specialty_code, rule_id) on ai_specialty_cohorts.
Verify all indexes created.

## Tests
No specific unit tests for this task — verified by migration commands.

## Run After Completion
After completing your changes, run:
```bash
cd apps/api && pnpm drizzle-kit generate 2>&1 && pnpm drizzle-kit migrate 2>&1
```
Fix any errors before finishing.
