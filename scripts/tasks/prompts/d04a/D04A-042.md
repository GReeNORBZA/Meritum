# Task D04A-042: Security — physician tenant isolation for AHCIP data (MOST CRITICAL)

## Project Context
- Monorepo: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- API: `apps/api` (Fastify 5, TypeScript)
- Shared: `packages/shared` (Drizzle schemas, Zod validators, constants)
- DB: PostgreSQL 16 with Drizzle ORM
- Test: Vitest + Supertest
- Auth: Lucia sessions with RBAC middleware from Domain 1
- All queries MUST include physician_id for tenant isolation (HIA custodian boundary)
- Claims contain PHI — no PHI in logs, errors, or emails. PHN masked as 123******
- Domain 4.0 (Claim Lifecycle Core) provides base claims table, state machine, shared validation (S1-S7)
- This domain extends D04 Core with AHCIP-specific validation (A1-A19), fee calculation, batch cycle, and H-Link file generation

## What to Build

Create `apps/api/test/security/ahcip/ahcip.scoping.security.ts`.

Create two physician accounts (physician1, physician2) using createSecurityPair fixture. Each creates AHCIP claims and batches.

**AHCIP claim detail isolation:**
- Physician1 cannot view physician2's AHCIP claim details → 404
- Physician1 cannot view physician2's fee breakdown → 404

**Batch isolation:**
- Physician1 cannot see physician2's batches via GET /ahcip/batches → empty
- Physician1 cannot view physician2's batch details → 404
- Physician1 cannot retry physician2's failed batch → 404

**Assessment isolation:**
- Physician1 cannot view physician2's assessment results → 404
- Physician1's pending assessments query never returns physician2's batches

**Next batch preview isolation:**
- Physician1's next batch preview contains only physician1's queued claims

**IMPORTANT:** All cross-physician access returns 404, not 403.

Use the test helpers/fixtures from the project. Follow the security test patterns established in Domain 4.0 (check `apps/api/test/security/claim/claim.scoping.security.ts` for reference). See `CLAUDE.md` for coding conventions.

## Dependencies

- D04A-030 must be complete (all AHCIP routes registered).

## Run After Completion

```bash
pnpm --filter api vitest run test/security/ahcip/ahcip.scoping.security.ts
```

All tests must pass before outputting [TASK_COMPLETE].
