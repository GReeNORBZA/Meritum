# Task D04A-041: Security — authorization and permission enforcement for AHCIP routes

## Project Context
- Monorepo: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- API: `apps/api` (Fastify 5, TypeScript)
- Shared: `packages/shared` (Drizzle schemas, Zod validators, constants)
- DB: PostgreSQL 16 with Drizzle ORM
- Test: Vitest + Supertest
- Auth: Lucia sessions with RBAC middleware from Domain 1
- All queries MUST include physician_id for tenant isolation (HIA custodian boundary)
- Claims contain PHI — no PHI in logs, errors, or emails. PHN masked as 123******
- Domain 4.0 (Claim Lifecycle Core) provides base claims table, state machine, shared validation (S1-S7)
- This domain extends D04 Core with AHCIP-specific validation (A1-A19), fee calculation, batch cycle, and H-Link file generation

## What to Build

Create `apps/api/test/security/ahcip/ahcip.authz.security.ts`.

**Delegate permission tests:**
- Delegate with CLAIM_VIEW can GET /ahcip/batches → 200
- Delegate with CLAIM_VIEW can GET /ahcip/batches/:id → 200
- Delegate without BATCH_VIEW cannot GET /ahcip/batches → 403
- Delegate without BATCH_APPROVE cannot POST /ahcip/batches/:id/retry → 403
- Delegate with CLAIM_VIEW can GET /ahcip/assessments/:batch_id → 200
- Delegate with CLAIM_CREATE can POST /ahcip/fee-calculate → 200

**Role enforcement:**
- Physician can access all AHCIP routes
- Admin cannot view AHCIP batch details without explicit PHI access

Use the test helpers/fixtures from the project. Follow the security test patterns established in Domain 1 and Domain 4.0. See `CLAUDE.md` for coding conventions.

## Dependencies

- D04A-030 must be complete (all AHCIP routes registered).

## Run After Completion

```bash
pnpm --filter api vitest run test/security/ahcip/ahcip.authz.security.ts
```

All tests must pass before outputting [TASK_COMPLETE].
