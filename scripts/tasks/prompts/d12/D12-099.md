# Task D12-099: Full domain test suite: all unit + integration + security tests

## What to Build

Run the complete test suite for Domain 12 Platform Operations. Do NOT write new code unless tests fail.

1. Run all unit tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run src/domains/platform/`
2. Run all integration tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run test/integration/platform/`
3. Run all security tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run test/security/platform/`

If any tests fail: read the failure, fix the source code (not the tests unless the test is wrong), re-run.

After all pass, run the full suite one final time:
```bash
pnpm --filter api vitest run src/domains/platform/ test/integration/platform/ test/security/platform/
```

Verify these security test files exist and are non-empty:
- test/security/platform/platform.authn.security.ts
- test/security/platform/platform.authz.security.ts
- test/security/platform/platform.scoping.security.ts
- test/security/platform/platform.input.security.ts
- test/security/platform/platform.leakage.security.ts
- test/security/platform/platform.audit.security.ts

Verify integration test files exist:
- test/integration/platform/subscriptions.integration.ts
- test/integration/platform/status.integration.ts
