# Task D01-099: Full domain test suite: all unit + integration + security tests

## What to Build

Run the complete test suite for Domain 1 Identity & Access. Do NOT write new code unless tests fail.

1. Run all unit tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run src/domains/iam/`
2. Run all integration tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run test/integration/iam/`
3. Run all security tests: `pnpm --filter api vitest run test/security/iam/`

If any tests fail: read the failure, fix the source code (not the tests unless the test is wrong), re-run.

After all pass, run the full suite one final time:
```bash
pnpm --filter api vitest run src/domains/iam/ test/integration/iam/ test/security/iam/
```

Verify these security test files exist and are non-empty:
- test/security/iam/iam.authn.security.ts
- test/security/iam/iam.authz.security.ts
- test/security/iam/iam.scoping.security.ts
- test/security/iam/iam.input.security.ts
- test/security/iam/iam.leakage.security.ts
- test/security/iam/iam.audit.security.ts
